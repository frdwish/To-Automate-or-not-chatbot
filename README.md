1. Introduction
This report presents an interactive chatbot built using Streamlit to support strategic
decision-making in the operations case “To Automate or Not.
” The case involves a CEO
contemplating automation for a grocery distribution center. The chatbot simulates a
consultant by engaging users in natural-language conversation and offering real-time
financial analysis, visualizations, and strategic insights.
The chatbot offers an accessible and engaging tool to explore complex cost-benefit
calculations and gain clarity on whether automation is a prudent investment.
2. Problem Overview
A grocery distribution center is evaluating the automation of labor-intensive tasks. The CEO
seeks a data-driven recommendation. The chatbot acts as a virtual operations consultant to
help explore:
●
Current vs. automated labor costs
●
Gross and net savings
●
Break-even analysis
●
Strategic risks and recommendations
3. Chatbot Features
Built with: Streamlit + Python
Interaction Mode: Web-based UI (via browser)
Core Functionalities:
●
Responds to natural-language questions
●
Calculates:
○
Current and future labor costs
○
Gross and net savings
○
Break-even point
●
Generates:
○
Interactive charts
○
Employee impact summaries
○
Strategic recommendations
●
Displays data tables dynamically

“Should we automate?”
6. Summary of Analysis (Generated by Chatbot)
Metric Value
Current Labor Cost $12,272,000
Automated Labor Cost $10,257,000
Gross Savings $2,015,000/yea
r
Automation One-Time Cost $4,000,000
Annual Maintenance Cost $1,000,000
Net Annual Savings $1,015,000
Break-even Period ~3.9 years
Net Employee Change -44 employees
7. Chatbot Recommendation
✅ Proceed with automation
Rationale:
●
Cost-effective: $1M+ in annual net savings
●
Break-even in under 4 years
●
●
Strategic Fit: Aligns with CEO’s vision for innovation
Operational Gains: Higher throughput in shipping
Risks to Consider:
●
●
●
Job reductions (-44) may impact morale
$4M upfront investment requires strong liquidity
Potential for implementation disruption or tech obsolescence
Suggested Actions:
●
●
●
Roll out in phases
Offer reskilling and internal transfers
Establish cash buffer and change management plan

9.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
1.What are the current costs?
ANS:Current Annual Labor Costs:
●
●
●
Receiving: 50 employees × $12/hr = $1,248,000 per year
Holding & Picking: 250 employees × $17/hr = $8,840,000 per year
Shipping: 75 employees × $14/hr = $2,184,000 per year
Total: $12,272,000 per year
2.How much would automation save?
ANS:Savings Analysis:
●
●
●
Labor cost reduction: $2,015,000 per year
After maintenance costs: $1,015,000 net annual savings
Break-even: 3.9 years
3.What's the employee impact?
ANS:Employee Impact:
●
●
●
Current employees: 375 total
○
Receiving: 50
○
Holding & Picking: 250
○
Shipping: 75
After automation: 331 total
○
Receiving: 50 (no change)
○
Holding & Picking: 131 (-119)
○
Shipping: 150 (+75)
Net reduction: 44 employees
4.Should we automate?
ANS:Arguments FOR Automation:
●
Long-term cost savings (~$1M/year after year 4)
●
Improved operational efficiency
●
Competitive advantage through technology
Arguments AGAINST Automation:
●
Significant upfront investment ($4M)
●
Workforce reduction (44 jobs)
●
Additional $1M/year maintenance costs
Consider:
●
If the company has capital and prioritizes long-term savings →
Automate
●
If workforce impact is a major concern → Delay automation
5.What are the risks?
ANS:Potential Risks:
●
Technology implementation risks
●
Employee morale issues from layoffs
●
Hidden maintenance costs
●
Operational disruption during transition
●
Technology becoming obsolete
6.How many employees are affected by automation?
ANS:Employee Impact:
●
Current employees: 375 total
○
Receiving: 50
○
Holding & Picking: 250
○
Shipping: 75
●
After automation: 331 total
●
○
○
○
Receiving: 50 (no change)
Holding & Picking: 131 (-119)
Shipping: 150 (+75)
Net reduction: 44 employees
7.How long will it take to recover the automation cost?
ANS:Cost Information:
●
●
●
●
Current labor costs: $12,272,000/year
Automated labor costs: $10,257,000/year
One-time automation cost: $4,000,000
Annual maintenance: $1,000,000
9.What are the annual maintenance implications?
ANS:Annual Maintenance:
●
Recurring cost: $1,000,000 per year
●
●
Reduces gross savings but still yields $1,015,000/year in net benefits
Should be factored into long-term ROI analysis
10.Can you show a chart of savings vs costs?
ANS:Cost Information:
●
●
●
●
Current labor costs: $12,272,000/year
Automated labor costs: $10,257,000/year
One-time automation cost: $4,000,000
Annual maintenance: $1,000,000
10.How does automation affect individual store performance?
ANS: Automation can improve individual store performance by speeding up
order processing and fulfillment, reducing errors in picking and shipping, and
ensuring more consistent inventory availability. This leads to faster deliveries,
fewer stockouts, and overall better customer satisfaction at the store level.
